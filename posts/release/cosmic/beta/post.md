Thanks to all the hard work from our contributors, we are pleased to announce that the Lubuntu Cosmic Cuttlefish Beta (soon to be 18.10) has been released!

NOTICE

# Welcome to LXQt

This is the first Lubuntu milestone to be released with LXQt as the main desktop environment. The Lubuntu project, in 18.10 and successive releases, will no longer support the LXDE desktop environment or tools, and will instead focus on the LXQt desktop environment. You can find the following major applications and toolkits installed by default in this Lubuntu Cosmic Cuttlefish Beta release:

 - LXQt 0.13.0, with many bugfixes and improvements backported from upstream.
 - Qt 5.11.1, which is the first point release in the Qt 5.11 series.
 - KDE Falkon 3.0.1, which is based off of the Qt WebEngine toolkit.
 - The LibreOffice 6.1.1 suite, with the Qt 5 frontend.
 - VLC 3.0.4, for viewing media and listening to music.
 - Featherpad 0.9.0, for notes and code editing.
 - Discover Software Center 5.13.5, for an easy, graphical way to install and update software.

You can find a variety of other applications installed which aim to enhance your experience while staying out of the way of your normal workflow.

# What is Lubuntu?

Lubuntu is an official Ubuntu flavor which uses the Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment (LXQt). The projectâ€™s goal is to provide a lightweight yet functional Linux distribution based on a rock-solid Ubuntu base. Lubuntu provides a simple but modern and powerful graphical user interface, and comes with a wide variety of applications so you can browse, email, chat, play, and be productive.

# Where can I download it?

 - The ISO [could fail to boot](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1792932) under VirtualBox.

# Lenny Cuttlefish

Here he is!

Lenny has been Lubuntu's friendly mascot since the beginning, and for most releases, we have taken the Ubuntu mascot and fused it with Lenny to make it its own unique and fun release-specific creature. Thanks to the Lubuntu Artwork Team for your work in continuing a long standing Lubuntu tradition!
