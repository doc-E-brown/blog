# Want to help?

One of the easiest ways to get involved with Lubuntu and help us make this release the best one yet is to test Lubuntu and report bugs.

You can learn how to write an excellent bug report that helps us solve your issue quicker by reading [this guide](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

More information about testing on Lubuntu can be found [here](https://phab.lubuntu.me/w/testing/).

# Translations

We have [a Weblate instance](https://translate.lubuntu.me/projects/) available for translations. Right now there are not many strings to translate, but as time goes on, we will add more.

Do you speak a language that isn't available to translate there? Let us know in the comments or [elsewhere](https://lubuntu.me/links/) and we will add that language.

Here are the translators who have contributed so far:

 - Henrik Christiansen (Danish)
 - Hans P. Möller (German, Spanish)
 - Daniel Absmeier (German)
 - Luís Rafael Gomes (Portuguese)
 - Lucas A. V. Dantas (Portuguese (Brazil))
 - Marcin Mikołajczak (Polish)
 - Tony Cuesta Escobar (Catalan)
 - Einar Mostad (Norwegian Bokmål)

Thank you for your valuable contributions!

# Roadmap

You can find the Cosmic Cuttlefish release cycle [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CosmicCuttlefish/ReleaseSchedule).

You can stop expecting features on August 23, 2018 when Feature Freeze is put into effect. The beta is slotted for September 27, 2018 and the final release date for October 18, 2018.

Here are some major, Lubuntu-specific features you can expect before the release:

 - The beginnings of a welcome center (more details to come).
 - Calamares polish, including an additional module for more packages to be installed.

Our artwork team is still working on Lenny, and we'll let you know when we have Lenny Cuttlefish. :)
