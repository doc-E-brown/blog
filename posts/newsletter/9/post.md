# Roadmap

You can find the Cosmic Cuttlefish release cycle [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CosmicCuttlefish/ReleaseSchedule).

You can stop expecting features on August 23, 2018 when Feature Freeze is put into effect. The beta is slotted for September 27, 2018 and the final release date for October 18, 2018.

Here are some major, Lubuntu-specific features you can expect before the release:

 - The beginnings of a welcome center (more details to come).
 - Calamares polish, including an additional module for more packages to be installed.
 - A plan for replacing Openbox, the current window manager used in Lubuntu.

Our artwork team is still working on Lenny, and we'll let you know when we have Lenny Cuttlefish. :)
